## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker 20.10+
- Docker Compose 2.0+
- Node.js 18+
- Git
- 4GB RAM minimum
- 20GB free disk space
- A sandboxed environment (VM, container, or isolated network)

### Installation

1. **Set up a sandboxed environment:**
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Create a new VM
   # Option 2: Use Docker's network isolation
   # Option 3: Set up a dedicated test network
   ```

2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/akintunero/vulnerable-telecoms-portal.git
   cd vulnerable-telecoms-portal
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
cd admin-ui
npm install
```

4. Configure environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

5. Start the services:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

6. Initialize the database:
```bash
./init-db.sh
```

7. Access the services:
- Admin Dashboard: http://localhost:3001
- API Backend: http://localhost:5001
- Router UI: http://localhost:3003
- Social Platform: http://localhost:3002

## üîí Security Considerations

This project is designed for educational purposes and security research. Please note:

- **ALWAYS run in a sandboxed environment**
- All services run in isolated Docker containers
- Default credentials are used for demonstration
- Production deployment requires proper security hardening
- Regular security updates are recommended
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Use secure communication channels (TLS)
- Follow security best practices
- Enable audit logging and monitoring
- Implement rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Use secure password policies
- Regular security assessments
- Backup and disaster recovery planning

### Sandboxing Recommendations

1. **Virtual Machine:**
   - Use a dedicated VM with no access to production networks
   - Configure VM networking in isolated mode
   - Regular VM snapshots for testing
   - No shared resources with host system

2. **Docker Environment:**
   - Use Docker's network isolation features
   - Implement resource limits
   - Regular container cleanup
   - No volume mounts to host system

3. **Network Isolation:**
   - Dedicated test network
   - No access to production systems
   - Firewall rules to prevent external access
   - Regular network monitoring

4. **System Requirements:**
   - No sensitive data on host system
   - Regular system updates
   - Antivirus/malware protection
   - Network monitoring tools

## üêõ Known Issues

- See the [Issues](https://github.com/akintunero/vulnerable-telecoms-portal/issues) page
- Check the [FAQ](docs/FAQ.md) for common problems
- Review the [Troubleshooting Guide](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md)
- **IMPORTANT**: Running without proper sandboxing may expose your system to security risks
