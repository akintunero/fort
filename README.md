## üîí Security Considerations

This project is designed for educational purposes and security research. Please note:

- **ALWAYS run in a sandboxed environment**
- All services run in isolated Docker containers
- Default credentials are used for demonstration
- Production deployment requires proper security hardening
- Regular security updates are recommended
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Use secure communication channels (TLS)
- Follow security best practices
- Enable audit logging and monitoring
- Implement rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Use secure password policies
- Regular security assessments
- Backup and disaster recovery planning

### Sandboxing Recommendations

1. **Virtual Machine:**
   - Use a dedicated VM with no access to production networks
   - Configure VM networking in isolated mode
   - Regular VM snapshots for testing
   - No shared resources with host system

2. **Docker Environment:**
   - Use Docker's network isolation features
   - Implement resource limits
   - Regular container cleanup
   - No volume mounts to host system

3. **Network Isolation:**
   - Dedicated test network
   - No access to production systems
   - Firewall rules to prevent external access
   - Regular network monitoring

4. **System Requirements:**
   - No sensitive data on host system
   - Regular system updates
   - Antivirus/malware protection
   - Network monitoring tools
